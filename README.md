# Image Search

This is a simple image search app that I created with React as part of [Stephen Grider's](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) Modern React with Redux course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). Supported by [Unsplash's API](https://www.unsplash.com/developers/), users can instantly search for images in this app.
